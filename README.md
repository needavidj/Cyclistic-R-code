# Cyclistic-R-code
R code used for Cyclistic Bike-share project

This repository contains the R code and related files for the (fictitious) Cyclistic Bikeshare Analysis project. 
This project is part of a larger effort to understand the differences between annual members and casual
riders of the Cyclistic bike-sharing system in Chicago, and to identify ways to encourage more people 
to become annual members.
